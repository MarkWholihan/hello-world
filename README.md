# hello-world
Just another repository
I am Mark Wholihan, I am a forensic genetic genealogist and I am very passionate about DNA, and genealogy which is why I am working on my undergrad at Eastern Michigan University in Computer Science and minoring in Biology. I want to get into a bioinformatics or population genetics position at a company like Ancestry or 23 and me.
